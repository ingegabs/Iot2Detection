# Datasheet 


## Motivation
The RT-IoT2022, is a proprietary dataset derived from a real-time IoT infrastructure, is introduced as a comprehensive resource integrating a diverse range of IoT devices and sophisticated network attack methodologies. 
 
## Composition
The instances in the RT-IoT2022 dataset represent network traffic flows generated by IoT devices operating within a real-time testbed environment. Each instance corresponds to a single bidirectional communication flow between devices the devices
* ThingSpeak-LED – a cloud-controlled LED system communicating via MQTT.
* Wipro Smart Bulb – representing a common IoT lighting device.
* MQTT-Temperature Sensor – a sensor node transmitting environmental data over MQTT.
* Raspberry Pi nodes – used as both IoT gateways and attacker machines to generate and capture network traffic.

It includes statistical features that describe its network behavior — such as packet counts, byte sizes, flow duration, and inter-arrival times. These instances collectively capture both normal IoT operations and malicious activities (e.g., DoS, DDoS, brute-force SSH, and port scanning), providing a detailed representation of how IoT network traffic behaves under various conditions.

It do not have missing data and or confidential information.

## Collection process

The collection process of the RT-IoT2022 dataset involved setting up a real-time IoT network testbed composed of multiple heterogeneous IoT devices communicating under both normal and attack conditions. Network traffic was continuously monitored using the Zeek network monitoring tool and the Flowmeter plugin, which extracted detailed bidirectional flow statistics for each network interaction.

Data collection followed a two-phase approach:

* Benign traffic capture: normal device operations were recorded, such as sensor data transmission, cloud communication, and device control via MQTT and HTTP protocols.

* Attack traffic generation: controlled cyberattacks (e.g., DoS_SYN_Hping, DDoS_Slowloris, Brute Force SSH, Port Scanning) were launched using tools like Hping3, Slowloris, and Nmap from attacker nodes within the same network.

All traffic was labeled according to the activity type and stored as structured flow records. This process ensured the dataset reflected realistic timing, packet behavior, and protocol diversity found in operational IoT environments while maintaining reproducibility and controlled labeling accuracy.

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

The **RT-IoT2022 dataset** underwent several **preprocessing, cleaning, and labeling** steps to ensure data quality and usability for machine learning and intrusion detection experiments.

**Preprocessing and Cleaning**

* **Feature extraction:** Raw network packet captures (PCAP files) were processed using **Zeek** and **CICFlowMeter** to extract **bidirectional flow features** such as flow duration, total packets, bytes sent, inter-arrival times, and flag counts.
* **Data cleaning:** Incomplete or corrupted flows were **removed**, and features containing **missing or infinite values** were replaced with zeros or mean-imputed where appropriate.
* **Normalization:** Continuous numerical features were **normalized or standardized** to ensure consistent scaling, especially for models sensitive to feature magnitude.

**Labeling**

Each flow was manually labeled based on the known traffic conditions during collection — categorized as “Benign” or one of several attack types (e.g., *DoS_SYN_Hping*, *DDoS_Slowloris*, *BruteForce_SSH*, *PortScan*). These labels were verified against the attack scripts executed during data generation to ensure accuracy.

**Raw Data Preservation**

The raw packet capture (PCAP) files were saved alongside the processed dataset. This allows future researchers to re-extract features, apply different preprocessing methods, or test new intrusion detection algorithms under varying conditions — ensuring reproducibility and extensibility of the dataset for future work.


## Uses

The RT-IoT2022 dataset can be applied to a variety of cybersecurity and IoT-related research tasks beyond intrusion detection. Some applications include:

* Anomaly detection and behavior modeling of IoT devices.
* Feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques for lightweight security systems.
* Benchmarking of machine learning models in resource-constrained environments.
* Network traffic classification and protocol analysis for optimizing IoT communication efficiency.
* Transfer learning and federated learning experiments for decentralized IoT security.

**Considerations and Potential Risks**

There are several important aspects of the dataset’s composition and collection process that may impact its future use:

* The dataset was generated in a controlled testbed environment, meaning the traffic may not capture all real-world noise and variability seen in large-scale IoT deployments. Using it as a direct production benchmark without adaptation could lead to overfitting or reduced generalizability.
* Since the dataset contains synthetic attacks executed in isolation, the class distribution is imbalanced, which can bias models toward frequent attack types and cause false positives or negatives in minority classes.
* The dataset includes no personal or user-identifiable data

 **Tasks for Which the Dataset Should Not Be Used**

The dataset should not be used for:

* Human behavior prediction or identity profiling, as it contains only device-generated traffic.
* Commercial deployment of intrusion detection systems without real-world validation, since the data does not fully represent production-scale IoT diversity.
